# OCT-Core

The OCT-Core (or OCT Transparency Module) is a module of the [Open City Toolkit](https://github.com/geo-c/Open-City-Toolkit), which provides technical means of linking apps to the datasets that they use, as well as some statistics about the frequency of retrieval of a specific dataset.

The objective of the OCT transparency module is to help answer the following questions: 
+ What are datasets available in my city? 
+ How often are these datasets used? 
+ Which apps use these datasets? 


### Demo
A demo of the OCT Transparency Module is accessible at [OCT Core Demo](http://giv-oct.uni-muenster.de:8080/).
